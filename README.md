# Game of Potter
Have you ever wanted to know which Harry Potter and Game of Thrones characters could be BFFS? No? Well too bad! Mob-programming project created in React that utilizes 3 APIs to show a friendship match between Game of Thrones and Harry Potter characters with a Toronto date night selection depending on their match rating.

## Built With

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 
* [Harry Potter API](https://hp-api.herokuapp.com/)
* [got-api](https://api.got.show/doc/)
* [zomato](https://www.zomato.com/)
* [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org/)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Animista](https://animista.net/)



## Stretch Goals
* Implement a loading screen for images to improve user experience (got images may take awhile to load and show undefined briefly).
* Implement more date night options from Zomato and figure out a way to make less API calls.
* Strange edge case error occurs where more than 3 restaurants may appear - squash this bug. ðŸ˜±
